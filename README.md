I am EarthToAccess, a 21 year old guy who enjoys coding and programming. I'm a Roblox developer, and I create useful module scripts and UIs for various games and more. Check out all my repositories, if that interests you!

### What public repositories do you have?

My main public repositories can be listed below. These are the ones being actively maintained.

1. [Eos, the best Elemental Battlegrounds UI then, now, and forever.](../../../Eos)
2. [PFL, short for Player From List; a quick and easy player string search.](../../../PFL)

### What's with all the linked badges up there?

I do a lot more that just programming and coding.

- On my YouTube and SoundCloud, I make music (though I'm *much* more active on my SoundCloud). You can even check out some of my releases on Spotify and Apple Music!
- On my Twitter... I'm not actually that active on there, come to think of it. But occasionally when I am it's for updates about my variety of stuff I make.
- On my Reddit, I just bullshit really. I comment, I jest, I scream at low-effort spammers. Yknow, the whole nine yards.
- On my Twitch, I decide every once in a blue moon to stream. Otherwise, you might catch me in some chats.
