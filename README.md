I'm Terra, a 22 year old gal who enjoys coding and programming! I'm a Roblox developer, and I occasionally create useful module scripts and UIs for various games and more. Check out all my repositories, if that interests you!

### What public projects do you have?

My main public projects can be listed below. These are the ones being actively maintained.

1. [PFL, short for Player From List; a quick and easy player string search.](../../../PFL)

There are a few projects that are public, but archived;

1. [Eos, the best Elemental Battlegrounds UI then, now, and forever.](../../../Eos)

### What's with all the linked badges up there?

I do a lot more that just programming and coding.

- On my YouTube and SoundCloud, I make music (though I'm *much* more active on my SoundCloud). You can even check out some of my releases on Spotify and Apple Music!
- My Twitter is primarily for my rants, updates on my music and/or rare video, and is generally my go-to for tomfoolery.
- For Reddit, I just bullshit really. I comment, I jest, I scream at low-effort spammers. Yknow, the whole nine yards.
- On my Twitch, I decide every once in a blue moon to stream. Otherwise, you might catch me in some chats.
